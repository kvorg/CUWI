You can install CUWI using CPAN, i.e: cpan install CWB::CUWI

CUWI depends on Mojolicious, which has no out-of-core dependencies. If
you wish to deploy cuwi without installation, you can:

 * copy the lib directory, cuwi script and config file to your deployment
   location
 * copy Mojolicious lib directory in the same location
 * adjust PERL5LIB env variable to help cuwi script find its modules

CUWI needs its CWB::Model component to be able to find your
registries. You can rely on CWB::Config, use CORPUS_REGISTRY
environment variable or set the value in cuwi.json (see
examples/cuwi.json). The latter expect a colon-delimited list of
registry directories. Unlike CWB itself, cuwi will ignore registry
files that look like editor backups and will try to parse corpus info
files for additional information to deduce corpus encoding and
generate help/tool-tip information. 

See cuwi pod/man and CWB::Model pod/man for details.

For deployment information, see Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook.

For customization, see Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering and cuwi help inflate.

Examples:
---------

* Development mode (single server, low performance, informative error pages):

  PERL5LIB=./lib cuwi daemon --listen http://*:3000

  (see cuwi help daemon for more options)

* Production mode pre-forking server:

    PERL5LIB=./lib cuwi generate hypnotoad # generates hypnotoad.conf
    # edit hypnotoad.conf and cuwi.json to your leisure
    mkdir log                              # enables logging
    # start pre-forking server:
    PERL5LIB=./lib path-to-mojolicious-bin/hypnotoad cuwi
    # kill preforking server
    kill `cat hypnotoad.pid`

  (see Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad for more info)

For production in other deployment modes such as plackup, plackup with
modperl, cgi, fastcgi, preforking server behind a proxy (nginx,
apache), see Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook.
