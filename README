               CUWI - Corpus Users' Web Interface
               ----------------------------------

CUWI is a full-featured web front-end for corpora prepared with CWB -
the IMS Corpus WorkBench (http://cwb.sourceforge.net/). It uses its
own back-end layer, CWB::Model. CWB::Modle is a CWB registry, corpus,
info and query model layer which uses the CWB::CQP module and a
background cqp query processor to query corpora.

CUWI has no dependencies on CWB::CL and C-level bindings to CWB, and
is therefore relatively version agnostic as regards to CWB - is should
work with any cqp no later than version 2.0.0.

CUWI uses its CWB::Model to parse your registry files and present you
with a list of available corpora. For each corpus, a suitable search
form is used, listing attributes, alignments and other options. It
supports KWIC output, sentences, paragraphs, sequences and more.

CWB::Model and related modules require Mojolicious (they are build on
Mojo infrastructure), but can be used independently in your scripts and
do not imply a web interface per se.

CUWI's web interface is build using Mojolicious and thus includes
features such as templating, template customization for your site,
internationalization, deployment in most possible web environments
(including production-grade stand-alone perl server) etc. See
http://mojolicio.us/ for more info.


Feature highlights:
-------------------

* Queries can be specified in a simplified globbing expression using
  form options, full CQP query language or a combination.

* Clean encoding support for different corpus encodings (fully
  functional regular expressions for UTF-8 require a recent CWB
  distribution).

* Tool-tips and informational blocks extracted from special-format
  information in corpus registry info files are used to help the user
  throughout the interface.

* Query results are available in a number of formats, where new ones
  can be easily added with user templates at your leisure.

* Welcome message, CSS and HTML layout can all be adapted to your site
  using config files and template overrides.

* Result navigation: contextual links allow the user to see a larger
  context for each hit or to perform a search for a specific
  combination in a frequency table.

* Virtual corpora: you can configure CUWI to present a corpus differently,
  or query and present multiple corpora as a single large corpus in different
  ways.

A number of additional features are in the pipeline:

 * frequencies and collocations using cwb-corpus-scan

 * support for asynchronous queries (better performance with high loads)

 * support for sub-corpora and chained queries

 * graphical aids in frequency tables

 * many more ease-of use and advanced features
