* CWB::Model BUGS:

** Always assume the 'word' attribute, even when missing in registry
** In paging with Result objects, the end page calculation is wrong
** Structure handling in Query
   (what???)
** Default overrides new for ingorecase
** Bug in combined query syntax: a* [word="t.*"], add test!
** enable quoting of CQP escapes for "[rule]" and '[rule]'
   - change CQP heurisitcs
** Better tests/fails for failing/missing registry specifications
** Clean up newlines at the end of description

* CWB::Model

** Tests
** Implement max_size and max_querytime
** Native CQP and cwb-corpus-scan interfaces
** Possibly keep wordlists with paging and progressive building
** Concordance support
** Info files: translateable names/titles
** Add a handle for literal matching (no regexps) with %l
** Multicorpora
    - created with an external API from existing corpora
    - shuld send queries to multiple corpora and queue or mix the results
    - paging calculation should be optional, wrapped up in a function
      (and thus reusable for virtual corpora; pagesize and this needed)
    - corpus offsets should be included for virtual paging
** Test cwb beta release compatibiliy
** Sorting with multiple sort keys
** Wordlist and sorting/prunning using CQP features better
** Implement cached queries:
   - CWB::Model::Corpus keeps a pool of ageing Query objects, matched on query
   - queries are reused with different show options, paging etc.
   - possibly used to support chained queries
** Support for chained query support, list-oriented queries and macros, i.e. 
    /codist["whose", pos];
    /codist[lemma, "go", word];
** Non-blocking high performant queries using
    Mojo::IOLoop->timer(0, sub { poll query or render-cb ; reset timer; }
    or suitable newer solutions
    The query should have a flag when still running and refuse new request
    from the query cache API

* Web interface BUGS

** fix 51 to 42 out of 43 bug in kwic output
** disable context links for biggest display mode (sentence or paragraph)
** sanitize can't/does not work (readonly??) - tests
** make label and checkbox unbreakable in attributes
   (css?)
** possibly closures for exception handling are buggy
   - should rethrow the exception and catch it in webapp?
   - find a way to test all of this

* Web interface

** Use click-to popu-up for help
** cuwi favicon
** When more than 7 attributes are present, switch display to 4 drop-down lists 
   (possibly list selection performs a direct query redirect)
** Log cleanup:
   Production mode logging of queries and performance -> info
   Development: info->debug
** Add sample implementation with redirect to a fixed sample seeed [till May 8]
   [check status and add tests]
** Sorting, with options:
   - with 2 or three sort keys
** Split display modes into search, detail, frequencies, collocations
** Add generate config helper to cuwi command line, and help
** Multicorpora support as needed
** Present multilingual aligned corpora as a single entry?
   automatically with a drop-down menu to select the search corpus
** Cleanup of templates: separation with includes, I18n
** I18n
** Templates for query result exports
   for tab-delmited, cvs, xml, latex, json and data::dump
** Concordance support
   - probaly by supporting cwb-scan-corpus and disk-related
     long-polled results, see CWB::Model TODO
** More sorting and grouping for wordlists:
   - by frequency, by object found (using column headings for sort)
   - 2 or 3 sort keys = grouping
** Query compositing, see: http://nl2.ijs.si/fpj.html
** Use compositing or subcorpus to limit to structural atts with links

* Tests

** Finish CWB::Model tests
** CUWI Webapp tests
** Online tests for HTML and CSS syntax checking

* Release-critical

** tests
** colocations MI3 LL
** tabular download
** max_size, max_query_time
** I18n
** multicorpora
** documentation

* Future:
** corpus groups
   - main list lists groups and non-grouped corpora
   - groups need special description files -> default corpus, links to members
   - grouped corpora have corpus selectors for corpora within group
   - alternatively, use SISTER_CORPORA in info files for the drop-down menu
** structural constraints (with subcorpora)
