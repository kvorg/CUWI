* CWB::Model BUGS:

** Always assume the 'word' attribute, even when missing in registry
** In paging with Result objects, the end page calcualation is wrong
** Structure handling in Query
** Default overrides new for ingorecase
** Bug in combined query syntax: a* [word="t.*"], add test!
** enable quoting of CQP escapes for "[rule]" and '[rule]'
   - change CQP heurisitcs
** be more robust about failing corpora files

* CWB::Model

** Tests
** Add a handle for literal matching (no regexps) with %l
** Info files: translateable names/titles
** Multicorpora
    - created with an external API from existing corpora
    - shuld send queries to multiple corpora and queue or mix the results
    - paging calculation should be optional, wrapped up in a function
      (and thus reusable for virtual corpora; pagesize and this needed)
    - corpus offsets should be included for virtual paging
** Test cwb beta release compatibiliy
** Sorting (hopefully no perl fail-over)
** Implement max_size and max_querytime
** Wordlist and sorting/prunning using CQP features better
** Implement cached queries:
   - CWB::Model::Corpus keeps a pool of ageing Query objects, matched on query
   - queries are reused with different show options, paging etc.
   - possibly used to support chained queries
** Support for chained query support, list-oriented queries and macros, i.e. 
    /codist["whose", pos];
    /codist[lemma, "go", word];
** Non-blocking high performant queries using
    Mojo::IOLoop->timer(0, sub { poll query or render-cb ; reset timer; }
    The query should have a flag when still running and refuse new request
    from the query cache API
** Ugly workaround for sample/reduce display mode context links:
    Chained query on full context, then original search
** Paging and progressive building for bigger wordlists, or:
** Native CQP and cwb-corpus-scan interfaces
** Concordance support
** Cleanup newlines at the end of descritpion

* Web interface BUGS

** disable context links for sample and para display modes
** sanitize can't/does not work (readonly??) - tests
** Matches 253 to 253 out of 1454 -> context report should improve
** make label and checkbox unbreakable in attributes

* Web interface

** Make structural tooltips wider
** Add help tip about bigcontext links to the previous
** Add detail display
** Add sample implementation with redirect to a fixed sample seeed [till May 8]
** Split display modes into search, detail, frequencies, collocations
** Add generate config helper to cuwi command line, and help
** Multicorpora support as needed
** cuwi favicon
** I18n
** Present multilingual aligned corpora as a single entry?
** Cleanup of templates: separation with includes, I18n
** Templates for query result exports
   for tab-delmited, cvs, xml, latex, json and data::dump
** Production mode logging of queries - cleanup
** Soritng, with options:
   - by hit string, left / right token
   - ascending, descending, forward, a tergo (reversed)
   - by word or any other atribute
   - with 2 or three sort keys
** More sorting and groupig for wordlists:
   - by frequency, by object found (using column headings for sort)
   - 2 or 3 sort keys = grouping
** When more than 7 attributes are present, switch display to 4 drop-down lists 
** Query compositing, see: http://nl2.ijs.si/fpj.html
** Use compositing or subcorpus to limit to structural atts with links
** Concordance support
   - probaly by supporting cwb-scan-corpus and disk-related
     long-polled results, see CWB::Model TODO

* Tests

** Finish CWB::Model tests
** CUWI Webapp tests
** Online tests for HTML and CSS syntax checking
