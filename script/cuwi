=head1 NAME

cuwi - Corpus Users' Web Interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cuwi help
  hypnotoad cuwi

=head1 OVERVIEW

This document describes the CUWI Web application.

Please see L<CUWI Web users's Manual|CWB::CUWI::Manual> for help and
usage instructions.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<** documentation in progress, stand by **>

C<cuwi> is the starting script for CUWI (Corpus Users' Web Interface),
a web frontend for linguistic corpora encoded in (L<Corpus
WorkBench|http://cwb.sourceforge.net>) format. The application itself
is implemented in L<CWB::CUWI> and is written in Perl, using the
Mojolicious web framework|http://mojolicio.us/>.

CUWI uses a native pure Perl backend (L<CWB::Model>) and can access
CWB corpora through the L<cqp> command with no binary Perl
modules. L<CWB::Model> also permits scripting access to the
corpora. (See tests in the distribution archive for examples.)

=head1 INSTALLATION

Please see included INSTALL readme file for installation details. CUWI
depends only on the L<Mojolicioius|http://mojolicio.us/> framework and
the basic C<CWB> package.

Note that CUWI requires a reasonably modern Perl (v5.10.1 or later).

CUWI comes with the L<CWB::CUWI> package which includes L<CWB::Model> and
supporting packages for native Perl programming API to CQP query
language and CWB-encoded corpora, and L<CWB::CUWI>, the web application,
which this script is a part of.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Please see L<CWB::CUWI::Administration> for information on setup and
configuration of CUWI.

=head1 BUGS

This is a developer version. There are many. See TODO.

Note that sorting works properly by using C<locale> only if C<cqp> is
capable of using external sort.

Note that Unicode characters will not be treated properly with regular
expressions unless you are using C<CWB> v3.2 or later.
